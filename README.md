1) Install Git as a local program
2) Make a github account
3) Open Webstorm and connect Github to git by opening the system preferences, select vision control, then select git, and enter the path to git.exe
4) In Github, create a plus sign on the upper right corner to make a repository
5) When you're setting up the repository, make it public and add a readme file
6) To create a repository from Webstorm, select VCS and import it into version control
7) To import a repository from Github, enter the URL from Github
8) To add files to Git, when Add to Git opens, click Add.
9) Last, commit your changes and push it to remote repository

Glossary:
* **Branch**: shows branches made from Master which are being worked on locally
* **Clone**: creates a local copy of the project that exists remotely. This clone will include all the code, project's files, history and branches
* **Commit**: saves a snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process
* **Fetch**: allows you to download files and change from the remote to your local repository
* **GIT**: free and open source distributed version control system that is designed to handle everything from small to large projects with effiency and speed
* **Github**: a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to send better code through command line features, issues and pull requests a code for review
* **Merge**: when clicking merge, Github automatically perms the equivalent of a local git merge operation. 
* **Merge Conflict**: Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, Git needs your help to decide which change to incorporate to the final merge. Git can resolve difference between your branches and merge them automatically.
* **Push**: updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch
* **Pull**: updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart
* **Remote**: Common repository all team members use to exchange their changes/progress. The remote repository should be the most updated version of the code repository.
* **Repository**: place or container where something is stored
